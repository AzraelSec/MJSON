MJSON's a namespace created to manage the JSON objects (and in the future others JSON data-types) and theirs serializing and deserializing.
At the moment this program let you deserialize objects and get a Hashtable data-type with your informations.
I hope I'll have enough time to continue this project.
Bye! ;)
